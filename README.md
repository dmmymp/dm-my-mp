Yes — you **should absolutely improve the README** to help attract contributors and explain the project’s purpose. Right now, it's the default Next.js boilerplate, which doesn’t give devs or civic-minded collaborators any idea what **DM My MP** is for, why it matters, or how to get involved.

# DM My MP 📨🇬🇧

A civic tech tool to **make political engagement in the UK fast, simple, and direct**.

🔗 Live demo: [https://dm-my-mp.vercel.app](https://dm-my-mp.vercel.app)

---

## 🧭 What It Does

DM My MP helps UK citizens:
- Enter their **postcode** to identify their MP
- Choose a topic (e.g. housing, cost of living, environment)
- Write or receive **AI-assisted letter suggestions**
- Instantly **send a message** or share the issue

We aim to **increase accountability and democratic participation**, especially among people who normally don’t engage in politics.
