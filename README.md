## ðŸ§­ What It Does

DM My MP helps UK citizens:
- Enter their **postcode** to identify their MP
- Choose a topic (e.g. housing, cost of living, environment)

- Instantly **send a message** or share the issue

We aim to **increase accountability and democratic participation**, especially among people who normally donâ€™t engage in politics.
